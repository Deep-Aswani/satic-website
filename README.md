Satic - Career Utility Platform

Satic is a responsive, front-end career development platform designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry execution. Unlike traditional EdTech, Satic operates as a "utility tool," offering simulated work environments (internships) where users complete role-specific tickets to build verified portfolios.

Key Features:

• Practice-Based Architecture: Focuses on "Real Work" over video tutorials.
• Role Simulations: Dedicated tracks for Graphic Design, Data Analytics, and Frontend Development.
• Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences using modern CSS Grid and Flexbox.
